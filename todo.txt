TODOS:
0. the community cards are no longer visible when the hand was started.
1. the start hand button no longer disappears for all players after one player has clicked it. the button should only be visible right when the players join the table to start the first hand to go to the next hand after the previous concludes.
2. lets say player a has a stack of 1000 and player b a stack of 900. when player a goes all in for his 1000, then player b's call button should say: call 1000 but right now it says call 1000 instead (player b doesn't even have 1000). dont mix this up with the way the call button works in other scenarios though. when there is a bet of 1000 and a player has already put in 400 then the call button shows 600 which is correct.
3. preflop issue: when the small blind calls and the big blind moves all in and then the small blind calls the allin, then the button gets the option to check again. but since he is already allin he shouldn't have any more actions to begin with. this might be a bigger issue that happens in many scenarios. need to figure it out. maybe we can write some tests to catch this particular bug and from there on test similar scenrios on other streets with more than two players and see if the behaviour is correct.
4. to make it easier for me to test. please make it so that when the token a player has stored in the browser is not valid, the user is also just prompted to enter a name. right now when i restart the server i also need to run "localStorage.clear()" in the browser and i dont want to have to do that anymore.
