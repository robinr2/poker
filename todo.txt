TODOS:
3. preflop issue: when the small blind calls and the big blind moves all in and then the small blind calls the allin, then the button gets the option to check again. but since he is already allin he shouldn't have any more actions to begin with. this might be a bigger issue that happens in many scenarios. need to figure it out. maybe we can write some tests to catch this particular bug and from there on test similar scenrios on other streets with more than two players and see if the behaviour is correct.
3.1 (related to 3) the game suddenly enters a weird loop when this happens. after the player with less chips called the allin, the other player gets the options to check or fold again, then the player that called the all in gets the option to call again for a certain amount. all of this doesn't make any sense.
5. pot display is wrong: when turn completes the money is sometimes not added to the pot and sometimes it is and on the winner announcement modal there is a different pot amount display than on the game board.
